# Structure

How to use materials in different forms and various COTS pieces to create a robust and versatile structure system.

## Crush Blocks

Crush blocks pop up everywhere in modern frc design due to how frequently used fairly thin box tubing is. The main purpose of crush blocks is to prevent forces from buckling the thin wall of the tube. This is very easy to do by simply overtightening a bolt on the tube. By using a crushblock you are also are also able to tighten the bolts more than you would without having a crush block. This stiffens the connection and the tube as a whole.

    Crushblocks can be made of any material, but 3D printing them is by far the simplest method of manufacturing for crush blocks. Just make sure to account for printer tolerances. Crushblocks shouldnt be too loose, but you dont want to have to hammer them in.

Above is the most simple form of crushblock. Just a piece of plastic that fills the empty space within the tube with some holes for bolts to go through. For crushblocks specifically at the end of a tube you can include a flange to aide in alignment with the holes in the tube. Crush blocks may not be ideal for use in the middle of long tubes, since it would make it difficult to locate the crush block. Additional considerations include increasing the amount of walls to 4-6 when 3d printing.  

## Tube Plugs

Tube plugs are metal inserts that go into the ends of box tube that allow you to fasten tubes together without the use of gussets. This provides a simple and strong connection between tubes. Tube plugs find a major use in modern elevator designs due to how much they simplify the design process. By not having to worry about bearing blocks interfering with tube gussets you massively cut down on design complexity, while also cutting part count and robot cost. When bolting tube plugs to the tube you typically dont need to use all 8 available bolts, with 2-4 being acceptable for most use cases.

    Tube plugs are made to fit into tubes of 1/8" wall thickness. For tube with thinner walls you can use a simple plastic sleeve on the outside of the tube plug to fill the gap with no strength loss.
