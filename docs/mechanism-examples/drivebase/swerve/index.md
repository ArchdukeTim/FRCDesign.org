# Swerve Drivebases
The drivebase is the single most important part of your robot, providing a bed for every other subsystem to build off. Examples of different drivebases can provide inspiration for electronics layout, bellypan shapes, and structural cross members for mounting, all of which can be a hard but crucial part of designing a robot, as accessibility and maintainability need to be preserved even as subsystems get placed on top of the robot.
