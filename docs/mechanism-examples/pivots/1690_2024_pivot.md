# 1690's 2024 Lantern Gear Pivot

<figure markdown="span">
[![1690 Lantern Gear Pivot](../../img/mechanism-examples/pivots/1690_2024_pivot.webp){height=60% width=60%}](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/065fb1a7f111b2de05ba208b/w/67f48a3bae8c68dc38e22239/e/e16d7c04df2851292695e2e5){target = "_blank"}
<figcaption>This pivot was created by Team 1690 for their World Championship winning 2024 robot. It was built to pitch their shooter up and down, to aim the shooter. The pivot was designed to minimize as much backlash as possible using a sector gear and a lantern gear, and was inspired by 971's 2017 pivot design.</figcaption>
