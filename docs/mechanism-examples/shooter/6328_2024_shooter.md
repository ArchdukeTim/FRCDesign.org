<figcaption>Shooter made for the Crescendo game, to shoot 14" diameter, 2" thick foam rings up into a hooded goal. The shooter was designed to run the sides seperately, allowing the shooter to impart spin into the ring. The shooter was also mounted to a pivoting structure to allow for better aiming of the shot.</figcaption>
