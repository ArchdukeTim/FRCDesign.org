# FRC Robot Design Guide

Welcome to the design guide, the main purpose and content of the website! Keep in mind that it's always a work in progress, so if you find any issues or have difficulty understanding something, please [give us feedback](https://forms.gle/dQ6w6RXJa6vSmcpw7)!

The purpose of the guide is to take you from zero to being able to model a full robot. You can start at any point you like to if you already have experience with CAD in Onshape, but as the usage and workflow of Onshape for FRC is very different than most CAD softwares, we recommend you go through the full guide to learn the fundamentals so you don't struggle with more complex CAD.

The guide's content focuses on FRC-relevant features and tools, using engaging projects that not only introduce new CAD skills and practice old ones but also introduce engineering concepts. These projects slowly become more open-ended.

!!! Tip
    If you already have some experience with CAD in Onshape, you may skip to [Stage 1B](stage1/1B-powerTransmissions.md) for your first project and continue from there. It will help you start learning the preferred workflow to design mechanisms in Onshape.
